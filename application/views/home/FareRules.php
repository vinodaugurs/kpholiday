India for both domestic and international ×ights.
It is one of the largest airlines in Asia and in the
world. This is one of the best airlines considered
for both domestic and international ×ights.</p>    


<p><strong>Air India Cancellation Charge</strong> is applicable to all
the ×ights that are cancelled before the
departure of the ×ight on the respective date. If
the ×ight is booked with the reservations center,
then also the ×ight can be cancelled online and
can be modiÖed as well using your PNR number.
If the ×ight is booked for multiple passengers,
then the booking cannot be cancelled for a single
passenger forms multiple passenger ×ight
booking. If this has to be cancelled, then the
whole booking has to be cancelled for all the
passengers in that PNR.</p>   

<p>The <strong>Air India Cancellation Charge</strong> is 35% of the
basic fare along with the transaction fees and the
cancellation should not be made more than 10
days prior to the departure of your ×ight. If the
cancellation is being made between 1 to 10 days
prior to the departure of the ×ight, then the
cancellation charge is 50% of the basic fare along
with the transaction fees. If the cancellation is
made in less than 24 hours prior to the departure
of the ×ight, then there will be no refund. The
charges will get elapsed, though the taxes are still
refundable. The best thing about the cancellation
is that the refund is done in the same mode of
payment which was used at the time of booking
the ×ight. So the passenger needs not to worry
about the payment. If the passenger has used his
credit or debit card while booking the ×ight, then
the passenger may be asked to send his or her
bank account details to the refunding authority,
so that the refund can be done directly into the
respective passenger’s bank account.

  <p>Deutsche Lufthansa AG (IATA­Code LH), commonly known as Lufthansa, is the flag carrier of Germany and also the
largest airline in Europe, both in terms of overall passengers carried and fleet size. It operates services to 18 domestic
destinations and 197 international destinations in 78 countries across Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Europe, using a
fleet of more than 280 aircraft.
</p>
<p>Lufthansa's registered office and corporate headquarters are in Cologne. The main operations base, called Lufthansa
Aviation Center (LAC), is located at Lufthansa's primary traffic hub at Frankfurt Airport. The majority of Lufthansa's
pilots, ground staff, and flight attendants are based there. Lufthansa's secondary hub is Munich Airport with a third,
considerably smaller one maintained at Düsseldorf Airport which transfers to Germanwings so Lufthansa only operate
just around 10 destinations excluded seasonal which all has been transferred to Germanwings.
</p>

<p>Lufthansa is also a founding member of Star Alliance, the world's largest airline alliance, formed in 1997.

<h3>Cancel Flight respectively booking
</h3>

<p>If you have a ticket of Lufthansa and cannot use it, you should contact your Lufthansa and check whether it is possible
to cancel your flight. In case you can cancel your booking, ask if cancellation fees occur and/or if there are other
conditions. We provide you an overview of cancellation policies of selected airlines.
Please help us extending and keeping the overview updated ­ send us an e­mail if your airline is missing or you made
other experiences than shown: <strong>info@jumpflight.com.</strong>
</p>


<p>Regularly it is not possible to cancel flights ­ either for an airline in general or for special tariff classes. Even if it is
possible, refund might be very small.
</p>
<p>So another alternativ might be interesting for you: change of booking. Best case you can change date and flight route.
</p> 
<p>If this is no option for you ­ there might be another alternative: <strong>resell your flight!</strong>
</p> 
<p>Unfortunately as far as we know, Lufthansa do not offer so­called name change option. Nevertheless you should
contact them, perhaps they can offer you a solution for your individual case.
